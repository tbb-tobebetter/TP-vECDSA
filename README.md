# Simple Yet Fast Two-Party Signature Based on ECDSA Assumption

ECDSA is a standardized signature scheme and widely used in many fields. The distributed signature can avoid single point of failure and provide a high level of key protection. However, most distributed, even two-party ECDSA need complicated multi-party computation technique to compute the multiplication of many shared secrets and require expensive zero-knowledge proofs to deal with malicious adversaries.

In this paper, we consider the specific case of two parties and construct a simple and efficient two-party signing protocol based on ECDSA. For this purpose, we first introduce a variant of ECDSA called combinatorial ECDSA, which is as secure as the standard ECDSA, and can be split into two pieces easily. This enables us to devise a fast two-party signature from ECDSA without complicated multi-party computation. Compared with the state-of-the-art two- party ECDSA, in our protocol, the signing operation of each party is similar to the original ECDSA and easily verified by others, which avoids expensive zero-knowledge proofs and can achieve good performance. Last, we realize our two-party signature and the experimental results show that our proposed protocols are practical.
